# Neural-Network-Prediction-of-Solar-Energy-Devices
This repository shows the codes used to predict the performance of a solar-powered device 
The target device is a thermoelectric generator that directly converts thermal energy to electricity.
A regressive artificial neural network is built using the MATLAB nftool application.
The neural network predicts the device performance in just 15 s, which is 1,000 times faster than the conventional method.
The neuran network codes are attached. 
The findings of this work are submitted to Energies journal for publication consideration.
The neural network provides design information at a very fast rate, saving production companies time and expense. 
Enjoy!
